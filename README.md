# SimpleAntiForwardBot

ðŸ”„ A simple Telegram bot built with PHP that recreates forwarded messages using the `copyMessage` method of the Telegram Bot API.

---

## ðŸ”§ What it does

This bot automatically **copies** every message it receives (text, forwarded, etc.) and **re-sends it** using the `copyMessage` method.  
This way, the message looks like it was sent by the bot itself, not by the original sender.

Useful when:
- You want to hide the original source of a forwarded message.
- You want forwarded messages to appear like native bot responses.
- You want to understand how Telegram handles `copyMessage` via bot API.
